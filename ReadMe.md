A .NET wrapper for [tesseract-ocr] 3.05.02

## Dependencies

### Visual Studio 2015 x86 and x64 Runtimes 

Since tesseract and leptonica binaries are compiled with Visual Studio 2015 you'll need to ensure you have the 
[Visual Studio 2015 Runtime][vs-runtime] installed.

### Tesseract language data

You will also need to download the language data files for tesseract 3.05.02 from [tesseract-ocr].

## Getting started quickly

1. Add the ``Tesseract`` NuGet Package by running ``Install-Package Tesseract`` from the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console).
2. Ensure you have Visual Studio 2015 x86 & x64 runtimes installed (see note above).
3. Download language data files for tesseract 3.05 from the [tessdata repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/releases/tag/3.04.00) and add them to your project, 
   ensure 'Copy to output directory' is set to Always.
4. Check out the Samples solution ``~/src/Tesseract.Samples.sln`` in the [tesseract-samples](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract-samples) repository for a working example.

If you run into any issues please check out [this](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/wiki/Errors) wiki page which details a number common issues and some potential solutions.
